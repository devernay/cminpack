<h1>C/C++ Minpack</h1>

<h2>What is Minpack?</h2>

<p>This is the official description of Minpack, from the original ReadMe file:
Minpack includes software for solving nonlinear equations and
nonlinear least squares problems.  Five algorithmic paths each include
a core subroutine and an easy-to-use driver.  The algorithms proceed
either from an analytic specification of the Jacobian matrix or
directly from the problem functions.  The paths include facilities for
systems of equations with a banded Jacobian matrix, for least squares
problems with a large amount of data, and for checking the consistency
of the Jacobian matrix with the functions.</p>

<p>The original authors of the FORTRAN version are Jorge More', Burt
Garbow, and Ken Hillstrom from Argonne National Laboratory, and the
code can be obtained from <a href="http://www.netlib.org/">Netlib</a>.</p>

<p>Minpack is probably the best open-source implementation of the
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (in fact, it is even better, since it
adds to L-M automatic variables scaling). There is another open-source
L-M implementation in C/C++, <a
href="http://www.ics.forth.gr/~lourakis/levmar/">levmar by Manolis
Lourakis</a>, but unfortunately is is released under the GPL, which
restricts its inclusion in commercial software. Minpack is licensed under a BSD-like license (available in the distribution).</p>

<h2>What about CMinpack?</h2>

<p>In July 2002 (before <a
href="http://www.ics.forth.gr/~lourakis/levmar/">levmar</a>), Manolis
Lourakis (lourakis at ics forth gr) released a <a
href="http://www.netlib.org/minpack/cminpack.tar">C version of
Minpack, called CMinpack</a>, obtained from the FORTRAN version using f2c and some
limited manual editing. However, this version had several problems,
which came from the FORTRAN version:</p>
<ol>
<li>All the function prototypes were following the original FORTRAN call conventions, so that all parameters are passed by reference (if a function needs an int parameter, you have to pass a pointer to this int).</li>
<li>There were lots of static variables in the code, thus you could not optimize a function which required calling Minpack to be evaluated (a minimization-of-minimization problem for example): <em>The Minpack code is not reentrant.</em></li>
<li>If the function to be optimized has to use extra parameters or data (this is the case most of the time), the only way to access them was though global variables, which is very bad, especially if you want to use the same function with different data in different threads: <em>The Minpack code is not MT-Safe.</em></li>
<li>There was no C/C++ include file.</li>
<li>Examples and tests were missing from the distribution, although there are some FORTRAN examples in the documentation.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Why is C/C++ Minpack better?</h2>

<p>I took a dozen of hours to rework all these problems, and came out with a pure C version of Minpack, with has standard (ISO C99) parameters passing, is fully reentrant, multithread-safe, and has a full set of examples and tests:</p>
<ol>
<li>Input variables are now passed by value, output variables are passed by reference. The keyword "const" is used as much as possible for constant arrays. The return value of each function is now used to get the function status (it was obtained via the IFLAG or INFO parameter in Minpack).</li>
<li>All non-const static variables were removed, and the code was tested after that. Luckily, Minpack didn't use the nastiest feature in FORTRAN: all local variables are static, so that a function can behave differently when you call it several times.</li>
<li>The function to be minimized and all the Minpack functions now take an extra "void*" argument, which can be used to pass any pointer-to-struct or pointer-to-class, and you can put all you extra parameters and data in that struct. Just cast this pointer to the appropriate pointer type in your function, and there they are! There is no need for global variables anymore. Be careful if you access the same object from different threads, though (a solution is to protect this extra data with a mutex).</li>
<li>The Debian project did a C include file for Minpack. It still needed some work (add consts and C++ compatibility), so I did this work, and used the include file for the FORTRAN version as the base for my C/C++ version.</li>
<li>The Debian project also translated all the FORTRAN examples to C. I worked from these to produce examples which also call my C/C++ version of Minpack instead of the FORTRAN version. Also included in the distribution are reference output files produced by the test runs (for comparison).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Distribution</h2>

<p>The distribution contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>The CMinpack code, where static and global variables were removed (it is thus reentrant, but not MT-Safe).</li>
<li>The C/C++ Minpack code (reentrant and MT-Safe).</li>
<li>C and C++-compatible include files for Minpack or CMinpack (minpack.h) and C/C++ Minpack (cminpack.h), and Unix Makefiles.</li>
<li>Full original documentation, translated to HTML, and all the examples, tests, and reference test results, so that you can check if the code runs properly on your machine before really using it.</li>
<li>The extra covariance function "covar", with sample uses in the tlmder and tlmdir examples. Note that the result of covar has to be scaled by some factor, as shown in the source file examples/tlmderc.c (look for the documentation of the NAG function E04YCF for further explanations).</li>
</ul>

<p>It is distributed under the original Minpack license (see the file CopyrightMINPACK.txt in the distribution).</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1.1.2 (07/01/2011): Fix Windows DLL building (David Graeff) and document covar in cminpack.h.</li>
  <li>1.1.1 (04/12/2010): Complete rewrite of the C functions (without trailing underscore in the function name). Using the original FORTRAN code, the original algorithms structure was recovered, and many goto's were converted to if...then...else. The code should now be both more readable and easier to optimize, both for humans and for compilers. Added lmddrv and lmfdrv test drivers, which test a lot of difficult functions. Also added the pkg-config files to the cmake build, as well as an "uninstall" target, contributed by Geoffrey Biggs.</li>
  <li>1.0.4 (18/10/2010): Support for shared library building using CMake, thanks to Goeffrey Biggs from AIST and Radu Bogdan Rusu from Willow Garage. Shared libraries can be enabled using cmake options, as in: <code>cmake -DUSE_FPIC=ON -DSHARED_LIBS=ON -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF path_to_sources</code></li>
  <li>1.0.3 (18/03/2010): Added CMake support. XCode build is now Universal (i386+ppc). Added tfdjac2_ and tfdjac2c examples, which test the accuracy of a finite-differences approximation of the Jacobian. Bug fix in tlmstr1 (signaled by Thomas Capricelli).</li>
  <li>1.0.2 (27/02/2009): Added Xcode and Visual Studio project files</li>
  <li>1.0.1 (17/12/2007): bug fix in covar() and covar_(), the computation of tolr caused a segfault (signaled by Timo Hartmann).</li>
  <li>1.0.0 (24/04/2007): Initial revision.</li>
</ul>
